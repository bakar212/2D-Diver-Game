# 2D-Diver-Game
An arcade style video game where the player has to aim for the highest score
#
This game is called Skydiver 2d which features a controllable falling skydiver who's 
objective is to collect as many baloons as possible without colliding into a flying bird.
There are a limited number of lives the player has and every time the diver collides with a 
bird, a life is lost. The game is over when all lives are lost and ultimately the high score 
is displayed (through collecting baloons).
