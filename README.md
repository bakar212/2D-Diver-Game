# 2D-Diver-Game
An arcade style video game where the player has to aim for the highest score
#
This game is called Skydiver 2d which features a controllable falling skydiver who's 
objective is to collect as many baloons as possible without colliding into a flying bird.
There are a limited number of lives the player has and every time the diver collides with a 
bird, a life is lost. The game is over when all lives are lost and ultimately the high score 
is displayed (through collecting baloons).
#
The game has been developed using the Processing IDE including its relevent graphical libraries and has been
exported to a standalone executable file. Please find this executable called 'Game_2D' located inside the 
'Skydiver 2D' directory.
